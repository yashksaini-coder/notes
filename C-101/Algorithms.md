*An algorithm is a finite step-by-step process for solving a problem.*

It can be as simple as a recipe to bake a cake, or as complicated as the process to implement an autopilot system for a 747 jumbo jet. 

Algorithms generally start off with a problem statement. It is this problem statement that programmers use to formulate the process for solving the problem. Keep in mind that the process of building algorithms and algorithm analysis occurs before any program code has been written
