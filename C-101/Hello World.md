Only way to get good and learn a new programming language is to write programs in it. First program as we know is the famous `Hello World` that does nothing but print.

---
```C
# include <stdio.h>

int main(){
	printf("Hello World\n");
}
```

Simply save with `.c` extension and any compatible OS with the compiler installed will compile this program and then return out the main `a.out` file.

We can also specify the output name using the `-o` flag of the gcc compiler.

```C
gcc hello.c -o hello
```
