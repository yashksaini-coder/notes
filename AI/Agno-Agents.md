**Agents** are *AI programs* that execute tasks autonomously. They solve problems by running tools, accessing knowledge and memory to improve responses. Unlike traditional programs that follow a predefined execution path, agents dynamically adapt their approach based on context, knowledge and tool results.

This is the Agno AI framework, used to develop AI Agents very easily with support of many different tools and libraries.


## AI Engineering is Software Engineering

When building AI products, 80% of your solution will be standard python code, and the remaining 20% will use Agents for automation. Agno is designed for such use cases.

Using Agno AI framework, I can avoid unnecessary if-else logic and avoid complex abstractions like graphs and chains.
