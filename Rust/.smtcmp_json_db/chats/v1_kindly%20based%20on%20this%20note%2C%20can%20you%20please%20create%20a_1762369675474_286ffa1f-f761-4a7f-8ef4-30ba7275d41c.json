Here is an expanded version of your note covering Rust's language basics, structured with concepts from the official documentation and common roadmaps.\n\n<smtcmp_block filename=\"Language Basics.md\" language=\"markdown\">\nRust language basics cover fundamental concepts that form the foundation for writing effective code. This guide provides an overview of these core elements with examples.\n\n## Variables and Mutability\nBy default, variables in Rust are immutable. You can make them mutable by adding the `mut` keyword.\n\n```rust\n// Immutable variable\nlet x = 5;\n\n// Mutable variable\nlet mut y = 10;\ny = 15; // This is allowed\n```\n\n## Data Types\nRust is a statically typed language. Every value has a type, which the compiler can usually infer.\n\n### Scalar Types\nA scalar type represents a single value.\n- **Integers**: `i8`, `u8`, `i32`, `u32`, `i64`, `u64`, `i128`, `u128`, `isize`, `usize`.\n- **Floating-Point Numbers**: `f32` and `f64`.\n- **Booleans**: `bool` which can be `true` or `false`.\n- **Characters**: `char` represents a single Unicode scalar value.\n\n### Compound Types\nCompound types can group multiple values into one type.\n- **Tuples**: A fixed-size grouping of values with varied types.\n  ```rust\n  let tup: (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1);\n  let (x, y, z) = tup; // Destructuring\n  let five_hundred = tup.0; // Accessing by index\n  ```\n- **Arrays**: A fixed-size list where every element is of the same type.\n  ```rust\n  let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\n  let first_element = a[0];\n  ```\n\n## Functions\nFunctions are defined with the `fn` keyword. Type annotations are required for parameters and return values.\n\n```rust\nfn main() {\n    let sum = add_numbers(5, 10);\n    println!(\"Sum is: {}\", sum);\n}\n\n// Function with parameters and a return value\nfn add_numbers(x: i32, y: i32) -> i32 {\n    x + y // Expressions without a semicolon are returned\n}\n```\n\n## Control Flow\nYou can control the flow of your code using conditionals and loops.\n\n### If Expressions\nBranch code based on a condition.\n\n```rust\nlet number = 6;\n\nif number % 4 == 0 {\n    println!(\"number is divisible by 4\");\n} else if number % 3 == 0 {\n    println!(\"number is divisible by 3\");\n} else {\n    println!(\"number is not divisible by 4 or 3\");\n}\n```\n\n### Loops\nRust has three kinds of loops: `loop`, `while`, and `for`.\n\n- **`loop`**: Executes code indefinitely until you explicitly `break`.\n- **`while`**: Loops as long as a condition remains `true`.\n- **`for`**: Loops over the items from an iterator.\n\n```rust\n// Example of a 'for' loop\nlet a = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];\n\nfor element in a.iter() {\n    println!(\"the value is: {}\", element);\n}\n```\n\n## Comments\nComments are ignored by the compiler but are useful for annotating code.\n\n```rust\n// This is a single-line comment.\n\n/*\n This is a\n multi-line\n block comment.\n*/\n```\n</smtcmp_block>",
