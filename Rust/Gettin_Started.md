###### [Getting Started](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-00-getting-started.html#getting-started)

Main Key points to know is that, it affects the system on low level like Kernel, so it is very important to follow the guide-book and DO NOT MESS THIS UP.

- I'm going to be Installing Rust on Windows using WSL environment.
- As usual starts with Writing a program that prints `Hello, world!`
- Using `cargo`, Rust’s package manager and build system. 

At this point I wish I had ThinkPad with ==Arch== with Ricing
