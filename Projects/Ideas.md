## <u>Project Ideas</u>

- A Go based terminal that can be used to fetch Leetcode data, and solve Leetcode questions (hard).

- A new markdown system, that allows `css` animations to the markdown md files.

- Build a simple mp3 player create a proper TUI app, using rust, connect it with ***yt-dlp*** and setup a simple ***yt-scraper*** to download and store songs.

- CLI tool that lets me spin `turbo-repo`, `react.js`, `vite`, `vue`, `next.js`, `express`, with Auth implemented.

- Create a turbo or mono repo project, idea is to build a server to fetch Youtube transcript and summarize it, then create a good minimal UI frontend application for it to process and display that data. Possibly make the UI more like retro terminal like.

- A great project IDEA where one can connect and integrate with other socials and they can write posts, tweets, photos or generated image photos, also with proper profile, dashboard, settings, insights and analytics, section too, schedule AI agents to post,

- Build a rust based discord bot, with file read and access option, using mentions and all. For reference see this:- **[rustcentral](https://github.com/rustcentral/bot)**

- A webhook that can be used to get the twitter posts and send them to the quira's discrod channel, opensouls channels, and the Mine' twitter space channel. 
  
  Great point if we can create this into a proper SaaS type thing, where users can come sign up, and channels and then add a custom message to send the twitter post link along with that message.

- An MCP that can be used with using claude and obsidian. For Quira quest.

- A github action to get sponsors data of a user.

- An agno agent that can be used to fetch github day insights and then use it to post on twitter, and use mem0 to create stateful agents, using the agno + mem0 setup. 
  
  Additional context:- Most probably create a simple nextjs app where users can also signup, then select agents to shitpost, and then use github service as an extra tool, great idea

- A chainlit web app gui, to generate video animations using the python sdk manim. this is to ensure proper allowance, of the system.  Gotta deploy it on the Digital Ocean or GCP.
