# <u>Ideas</u>

- A Go based terminal that can be used to fetch Leetcode data, and solve Leetcode questions.
- A new markdown system, that allows `css` animations to the markdown md files.
- CLI tool that lets me spin `turbo-repo`, `react.js`, `vite`, `vue`, `next.js`, `express`, with Auth implemented.
- Create a turbo or mono repo project, idea is to build a server to fetch Youtube transcript and summarize it, then create a good minimal UI frontend application for it to process and display that data. Possibly make the UI more like retro terminal like.
